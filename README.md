AI  Job Market Impact Analysis
A Data-Driven Study on Industry Transformation and Salary Trends
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of job roles to understand the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption and Automation Risk. By leveraging Excel pivot tables and data modeling, I have identified which industries are leading the AI transition and how these factors correlate with compensation and future growth.

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
To measure the impact of AI on the workforce, I tracked the following metrics:

AI Adoption Index: A measure of how deeply integrated AI technologies are within specific sectors (Categorized as Low, Medium, High).

Average Salary by Automation Risk: Comparing compensation levels between roles deemed "High Risk" vs. "Low Risk" for automation.

Job Growth Velocity: The projected percentage increase in demand for roles based on their AI requirements.

Sector Resilience: The ratio of "Low Automation Risk" jobs within a specific industry.

🧩 Analysis Factors & Methodology
The analysis was conducted by slicing the data across several critical factors:

1. Industry-Specific Trends
Analysis of which sectors (Healthcare, Finance, Tech, etc.) have the highest concentration of high-AI adoption roles.

2. The Automation-Salary Correlation
Investigating if higher automation risk leads to salary stagnation or if high-skill "human-centric" roles command a premium.

3. Company Size Influence
Determining if Large Enterprises (5000+ employees) or Small/Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are more agile in adopting AI.
